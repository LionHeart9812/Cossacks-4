# ⚔️ Landsknecht-RTS
This is my newest python project using pygame! I try to recreate the popular RTS (real-time-strategy) game "cossacks" but with my own little twist. Inspired by tower-defence games I thought of combining both to ease the difficult-seeming start of a real rts-round. While this project is still in it's beginning, I would love to add to this cool idea by making new updates and adding new game features!

## 🐍 What did I work with?
- Visual Studio Code IDE
- `conda` -- Virtual enviorement
- `python` -- Version 3.14 as well as the python extension(s) in VSCode
- `pygame` -- Visit [pygame.org](https://www.pygame.org/news) to see more!
- `time` -- Python library for working with time
- `random` -- Python library for working with "randomness"
- [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl) -- Library for free assets and Tilemaps

## ⬇️ How to download?
Beacause this game is still in beta and the game isn't out yet, no installation is provided. 
With version 1.0 a .exe file as well as an installation guide with conda will be in the release tab
